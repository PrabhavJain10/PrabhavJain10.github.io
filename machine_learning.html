    <h1> How Machine Learning tools can help Identify Pulmonary Fibrosis </h1>
    <p> This is a project I worked on for a machine learning course. The result is not a fully trained model,
      but rather an exploration of a complex dataset and research on what cutting edge techniques a model should
      use in order to be both accurate and efficient. <br><br>
      Firstly then, what is the issue at hand? Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue
      gets damaged or scarred. The thickened, stiff tissue makes breathing more difficult as your lung function
      declines. Lung function is usually measured using a spirometer, which measures the volume of air a patient
      can inhale and exhale. The challenge is to predict future lung function decline in patients with pulmonary
      fibrosis based off a current CT scan, some metadata and a baseline spirometer reading called forced vital
      capacity (FVC). A model that could do so would provide doctors with a good indication
      of how serious a patients ailmment is. The images and data explored in this project are from the Open
      Source Image Consortium (OSIC) and are real clinical data.

    <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
    <p>The total training data set contains over 34,000 images from 176 patients and is about 13 GB of data.
      Additionally there is also a spreadsheet with metadata (age, sex, smoking status) of all 176 patients and
      around 1549 FVC measurements at different time periods.
